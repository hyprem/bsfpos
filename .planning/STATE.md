# Project State: Bee Strong POS Kiosk

**Last updated:** 2026-04-20 (08-01 complete — magiclineView.exists, closeAdminMenu helper, Ctrl+Shift+F12 toggle, reload fix, submit-pin-change IPC, credentials-changed audit)

## Project Reference

**Core value:** A gym member can walk up, scan or self-select a product, pay at the card terminal next to the kiosk, and walk away — without staff interaction and without being able to break out of the locked Magicline cash register page. (NFC member identification descoped 2026-04-14, see MILESTONES.md.)

**Current focus:** Phase 08 — admin-menu-polish-reload-fix

## Current Position

Phase: 08 (admin-menu-polish-reload-fix) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2

- **Milestone:** v1.1 Field-Operations Polish — STARTED 2026-04-14
- **Status:** Executing Phase 08
- **Phase:** 08 of 6 (admin menu polish & reload fix)
- **Plan:** 1 of 2 complete
- **Last activity:** 2026-04-20

## Key Decisions (Phase 07)

- **D-07-01:** appendSwitch('lang','de-DE') placed at top-of-file before app.whenReady() — must not be inside whenReady handler or silently no-ops (Electron #17995/#26185)
- **D-07-02:** persist:magicline webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders uses no URL filter — partition already isolated to Magicline traffic, avoids allowlist drift
- **D-07-03:** Header key uses exact casing 'Accept-Language' (not lowercase) to avoid duplicate-header issue per 07-RESEARCH.md §2
- **D-07-04:** BSK_REGISTER_SELECTED_DEGRADED checked before plain BSK_REGISTER_SELECTED (else-if) to prevent substring double-fire (T-07-07)
- **D-07-05:** welcomeTapPending flag gates splash:hide-final forward — cold-boot/idle-recovery paths unaffected by the new sentinel (T-07-06)
- **D-07-06:** detectAndSelectRegister replaced with bounded state machine — 1200 ms per-step timeout, 4800 ms worst-case, all German strings via LOCALE_STRINGS.de, chainFinish() always emits both markRegisterReady + emitAutoSelectResult on every terminal outcome
- **D-07-07:** hideSplash is the single cleanup entry point for all splash-hide paths (cold-boot, idle-recovery, welcome-path final, 5500ms safety timeout) — avoids duplicate cleanup logic across paths
- **D-07-08:** showSplash does NOT clear splashPendingMode — enterSplashPendingMode() is called before notifyWelcomeTap round-trip; main sends splash:show back which runs showSplash; clearing in showSplash would stomp the pending flag we just set

**Phase numbering note:** v1.1 continues from phase 07 because v1.0 ended at phase 06 and the v1.0 phase directories (`01-..` through `06-..`) are still present in `.planning/phases/` — v1.0 was reconciled manually rather than via `/gsd-complete-milestone`. Do NOT pass `--reset-phase-numbers` to any GSD command on this milestone.

**v1.0 (SHIPPED 2026-04-14):** 6 phases, 36 plans, 36 / 42 effective requirements (NFC-01..06 descoped post-ship). For accomplishments, see `.planning/MILESTONES.md`. For full archive, see `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md` and `v1.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## v1.1 Phase Overview

| Phase | Name | Requirements | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| 07 | Locale Hardening & Splash Race | LOCALE-01, SPLASH-01 | In progress (5/6 plans) |
| 08 | Admin Menu Polish & Reload Fix | ADMIN-01, ADMIN-03, FIX-01 | Not started |
| 09 | POS Open/Close & Update Gating | ADMIN-02 | Not started |
| 10 | Post-Sale Flow & Print Interception | SALE-01 | Not started |

Coverage: 7/7 v1.1 requirements mapped.

## Outstanding Field Work (v1.0 carry-over)

**Next kiosk visit batch (44 rows, all with automated backstops):**

- Phase 1: 5 rows — fresh-boot visual, splash permanence, double-launch race, prod-sim chord test, on-device runbook walk-through
- Phase 3: 1 row — TabTip manual-button re-verify on actual kiosk terminal
- Phase 4: 7 rows — IDLE-01..07 (IDLE-05 must run LAST, destructive). NFC-01..06 **DESCOPED 2026-04-14** (quick 260414-eu9). Several IDLE rows are subsumed by the Phase 6 welcome-loop walk; see `docs/runbook/v1.0-KIOSK-VISIT.md`.
- Phase 5: 30 rows — P5-01..P5-30 covering admin hotkey + PIN + lockout, RDP log spot-checks, auto-update + safe window, rollback drill, branded polish (P5-21..P5-24 rollback drill must run LAST)
- Phase 6: 1 row — 5-cycle welcome-loop smoke check (covers IDLE-01..05, AUTH-01..04 in one walk; NFC-05 facet N/A under descope)

Field guide: `docs/runbook/v1.0-KIOSK-VISIT.md`. Authoritative per-requirement specs in each phase's VERIFICATION.md, consolidated under `.planning/phases/01-locked-down-shell-os-hardening/01-VERIFICATION.md` "Human Verification Required (Next Kiosk Visit — consolidated batch)".

## Next Action

Run `/gsd-plan-phase 07` to decompose Phase 07 (Locale Hardening & Splash Auto-Selection Race) into executable plans. Phase 07 is the right first phase because LOCALE-01 removes the German-text fragility that SPLASH-01's auto-selection click chain depends on; doing it first means every subsequent phase runs against a locale-resilient baseline.
